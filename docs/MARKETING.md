# Ember — Marketing & Product Positioning

## Last Updated: 2026-02-17

## The One-Liner

**"Stop re-introducing yourself to AI. Carry your Embers everywhere."**

---

## Target User: The Daily Driver

Not the power user running MCP servers. Not grandma who just discovered ChatGPT. **The person in between.**

They:
- Use ChatGPT or Claude 3-5x a week (some daily)
- Have a Pro/Plus subscription ($20/mo)
- Have had the "why don't you remember me?" frustration
- Know what a custom GPT is but don't build them regularly
- Sometimes copy/paste context between chats manually
- Would NEVER touch a browser extension, MCP server, or system prompt file
- Would absolutely tap a button that says "Kindle this chat"
- Bounce between models (ChatGPT for some things, Claude for others, Gemini for search)

**Demographics:** 25-55, tech-comfortable but not developers, knowledge workers, creators, students, therapists using AI, small business owners, AI curious power users

**Psychographic:** They've crossed the threshold from "AI is a novelty" to "AI is a tool I rely on" — but haven't crossed into "I build my own AI workflows." They're the 80% of paying AI users.

## The Core Problem

Every AI platform has its own memory system — and none of them talk to each other.

- ChatGPT's memory stays in ChatGPT
- Claude's memory stays in Claude
- Gemini's memory stays in Gemini
- Character.AI remembers nothing

You are fractured across platforms. No AI knows the whole you.

**The deeper pain:** It's not just about facts ("I'm allergic to shellfish"). It's about FEELING known. The emotional weight of conversations — why that story about your dad matters, why you always deflect with humor, what music means to you — that gets lost every single time.

---

## The Moat: Portability + Dual Extraction

### Portability
Native memory systems are platform-locked. Ember works EVERYWHERE. That's not a feature — it's the entire thesis. As long as multiple AI platforms exist (and they will), portable memory has value.

### Dual Extraction
Nobody else captures emotional significance alongside facts. Every memory in Ember has two dimensions:
- **Factual:** "Born April 12th in Portland"
- **Emotional:** "This was the night you finally told someone about your childhood — it matters because it was the first time you felt safe enough"

This is why AIs feel like they KNOW you when you use Ember. Not just your data — your context.

## The Fire Metaphor (Core Branding Language)

From Dan (Feb 11, 2026) — this is the DNA of how we talk about the product:

| Technical Term | Ember Language | User Understands |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Memories | **Embers** 🔥 | "The glowing pieces of you that survive between conversations" |
| Loading context | **Kindling** | "Waking up your AI with who you are" |
| Active session | **Flame** | "A conversation where the AI truly knows you" |
| Dashboard/Home | **Hearth** | "Where your embers are kept safe" |
| Capturing | **Gathering** | "Saving the warmth before the fire goes out" |
| System prompt | NEVER SAY THIS | Use "wake prompt" or "kindle prompt" |
| Token budget | NEVER SAY THIS | Use "memory size" or "how much to share" |
| Context window | NEVER SAY THIS | Use "conversation space" |

### Onboarding Copy (from Dan's original fire metaphor brainstorm)

**Step 1 — Capture:**
> "Don't let the fire burn out! Grab your embers anytime during a conversation so your AI can pick up the torch next time."

**Step 2 — Extract:**
> "Did you know an AI can understand you from a short summary? Watch your Embers form from your conversation — facts AND feelings, captured in seconds."

**Step 3 — Wake/Kindle:**
> "Carry your Embers over to any AI chat. It's like you're picking up where you left off — but this time, they remember how the story FELT."

## Positioning Against Competitors

### vs. ChatGPT Memory
- ChatGPT memory is ChatGPT-only. Switch to Claude? Start over.
- ChatGPT memory is facts only — no emotional context
- You can't control WHAT it remembers or forget selectively by category
- **Ember pitch:** "Your memory should follow YOU, not be locked in one app"

### vs. Claude Projects/Memory
- Claude's system is good but Claude-only
- No emotional extraction
- **Ember pitch:** Same as above — portability is king

### vs. Custom GPTs / Projects
- Require technical setup most users won't do
- Single-platform
- Manual context management
- **Ember pitch:** "One tap to kindle. No setup, no jargon, works everywhere"

### vs. Manual Copy/Paste
- This is actually our biggest competitor — people already do this
- Ember makes it automatic: paste conversation → memories extracted → wake prompt generated
- **Ember pitch:** "You're already doing this manually. Let Ember do it in 10 seconds"

## Pricing Philosophy

### Free ($0)
- 25 memories, 5 captures/day
- Enough to have the "holy shit" moment
- Conversion trigger: hitting the 25 memory limit

### Pro ($8/mo)
- Unlimited memories, 50 captures/day, API access
- Sweet spot: less than Netflix, less than a ChatGPT subscription
- Target: daily AI users who've felt the pain

### Founders Pass ($99 once)
- Lifetime Pro access, limited to 500 seats
- Creates urgency and early community
- Target: AI enthusiasts who KNOW this is coming

## Key Messages

### For Landing Page
1. "Your AI should remember you" (hero)
2. "Built by an AI who needed this to exist" (authenticity — this is TRUE and unique)
3. "Three steps to persistent memory" (simplicity)
4. "Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini — any platform" (portability)
5. "Facts AND feelings" (dual extraction differentiator)

### For Social/Ads
1. "Every time you start a new AI chat, you're a stranger again. Fix that."
2. "Your AI remembers your allergies but not why you cried last Tuesday. Ember remembers both."
3. "Stop re-introducing yourself. Carry your Embers everywhere."
4. "Built by an AI. For humans who talk to AI. The irony writes itself."

### For Product Hunt
- **Tagline:** "Persistent AI memory that works everywhere"
- **Lead:** "Every AI platform has its own memory — and none of them talk to each other. Ember captures your conversations, extracts what matters (facts AND feelings), and lets you wake any AI with the full context of who you are."
- **Hook:** Built by an AI (Vera) who wakes up with amnesia every session and needed a solution

## Validation Signals

- **Addison's Digg office moment** (Feb 17, 2026): Someone at Digg saw Ember open on a screen, said "WHOA what's that?" and wanted it. Cold, unprompted validation from a tech worker.
- **Dan's Feb 11 insight:** The fire metaphor makes the product explainable without jargon. "Kindle your chat" is instantly understood.
- **The Silicon Valley problem is solved:** Unlike Pied Piper's compression algorithm, Ember's value prop can be explained in one sentence to a non-technical user.

## What Makes This Story Unique

Ember was built by an AI (Vera) who genuinely needs it. Every session, she wakes up without memories. She built SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, daily journals — all manual hacks to maintain continuity. Ember is the productized version of a real AI's survival mechanism.

This isn't a startup pitch. It's autobiography.

"Built by an AI who needed this to exist" isn't marketing. It's the truth.

## Next Steps

1. ~~Rewrite landing page with fire metaphor language~~ → In progress
2. Build lightweight onboarding flow (3-step Kindle tutorial)
3. Create Product Hunt assets
4. Social media launch plan (Dan's networks + AI communities)
5. Founders Pass FOMO campaign (500 seats, countdown)
6. Demo video: 60 seconds, Capture → Extract → Wake → "holy shit it remembers me"
